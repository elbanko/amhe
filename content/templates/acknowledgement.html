                    Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is a course most relevant in situations where it becomes apparent that people in your social or professional network are developing serious mental health problems and it may also provide useful information on how to assist a person who has a history of a mental disorder or longer term-mental health problems. The training, while intensive, is interesting and challenging. Enjoy!
